                                I am from a military family, and was born in Louisiana, but
                                we usually would travel every three years from Kansas, 
                                Alabama, Hawaii, and finally back to Alabama for good. I enjoy programming embedded systems, painting, 
                                playing Dungeons and Dragons as well as Magic: The Gathering, playing guitar, 
                                and circuitry. I am also a member of the TSA Cyber Security Team.
                                My certifications include HTML & CSS, Adobe Express, Digital 
                                Media Literacy, and was Enterprise Career and Technology Center student of the 
                                month. I hope to obtain a bachelor's in Computer Engineering with a minor in 
                                cyber security.

                                I love Enterprise, Alabama, having moved here about three years ago. I was 
                                born in Cuba and immigrated to the United States in 2012, after which I would 
                                proceed to travel and move states every 1 to 5 years.  I am certified in HTML 
                                & CSS, Adobe InDesign, and Digital Literacy. I spend my free time working on 
                                independent projects and consuming multimedia. I am interested in computers, 
                                programming, design, and art, though lately I have been considering branching 
                                out into music and perhaps nonfiction writing.
