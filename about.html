                                I was born in Enterprise, Alabama, and have spent my whole life here.
                                I spend my free time creating video games, reading Sci-Fi books,
                                collecting retro gaming systems, listening to music, creating art, and 
                                learning about History. I am certified in Microsoft Word & PowerPoint as well as 
                                Adobe Indesign. I am an active member of
                                my chapter's robotics team. I plan to get a bachelor's degree in cyber security after
                                four years at Troy University.

                                I am from a military family, and was born in Louisiana, but
                                we usually would travel every three years from Kansas, 
                                Alabama, Hawaii, and finally back to Alabama for good. I enjoy programming embedded systems, painting, 
                                playing Dungeons and Dragons as well as Magic: The Gathering, playing guitar, 
                                and circuitry. I am also a member of the TSA Cyber Security Team.
                                My certifications include HTML & CSS, Adobe Express, Digital 
                                Media Literacy, and was Enterprise Career and Technology Center student of the 
                                month. I hope to obtain a bachelor's in Computer Engineering with a minor in 
                                cyber security.

                                programming, technology, graphic design, and art, though lately I have been 
                                considering branching out into nonfiction writing and perhaps music. 
                                My goal is to get into MIT and graduate with a major in Computer Science
