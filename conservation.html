        <h3>Importance of conservation</h3>
        <p>
            On this page you can learn about the many ways a homeowner can help promote a clean environment 
            without making any big decisions. These tips will allow you to do your part for the environment 
            in a way that is cost-effective, useful, and impactful. Reducing carbon emissions from vehicles, 
            recycling, and saving energy are all practices that have been in place for decades within the 
            United States, and you can help continue them with the information below.

                            The best way to reduce emissions via motor vehicles is simply to use alternative <br>
                            methods. We recommend using methods such as biking, walking, carpooling, and <br>
                            using public transportation. Biking and walking are great ways to improve your <br>
                            health, while carpooling and public transportation help save gas. If you would <br>
                            prefer to use a car, you can save gas and emissions by making sure not to idle <br>
                            unnecessarily as recomended by the <a href = "https://afdc.energy.gov/conserve/idle_reduction_benefits.html#:~:text=Reducing%20vehicle%20idling%20time%20saves,especially%20for%20heavy%2Dduty%20trucks" target=“_blank”>US Department of Energy</a>. Another option <br> 
                            for travel is using electric and hybrid vehicles. These cars aretylish, quiet, <br>
                            and clean. We recommend you check out <a href="https://www.tesla.com/" target=“_blank”>Tesla</a>, <a href="https://automobiles.honda.com/" target=“_blank”>Honda</a>, and <a href="https://www.toyota.com/electrified-vehicles/" target=“_blank”>Toyota</a>

                        Another way to help the environment is to simply cut down on the large amount of <br>
                        excess water and electricity that your household uses. By doing so a huge amount <br>
                        of money can be saved come time to pay the bills. The ways a homeowner can do this is <br>
                        through taking shorter showers, fixing leaky faucets, and using water-efficient <br>
                        appliances as well as turning off lights not in use and unplugging electronics.<br>

                            Implementing effective waste management practices at home is an essential step <br>
                            towards a better future. Consider reducing single-use plastics by opting for <br>
                            reusable alternatives such as cloth bags, stainless steel water bottles, and glass <br>
                            containers. Additionally, composting organic waste not only diverts valuable <br>
                            nutrients from landfills but also enriches soil health and reduces greenhouse gas <br>
                            emissions, learn more at the <a href="https://www.epa.gov/recycle/composting-home" target=“_blank”>EPA website</a>. When shopping, choose products with<br>
                            minimal packaging or packaging made from recyclable materials. <br>
                            Buying in bulk can also help reduce packaging waste. By adopting these <br>
                            eco-friendly habits and reducing overconsumption, we can all play a part in <br>
                            preserving our planet for future generations.<br>

                    By taking these simple steps you can help our planet a little bit every day. 
                    There are many methods equally valid, whether they be as big as investing in an 
                    electric vehicle or as little as turning off unneeded lights. By reducing waste and 
                    practicing conservation we can all make a big difference together.
