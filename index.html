            Welcome to the Wildcat Green Energy initiative. Right now our planet is suffering from the 
            harmful effects of global warming. This occurs when Carbon dioxide and other air pollutants
            are released into the atmosphere, thereby trapping solar radiation within the Earth and creating
            a greenhouse effect. Despite the fearful circumstances, we believe that every American can help end this climate
            crisis by using renewable energy and reducing emissions. Wildcat Energy is comitted to helping you achieve 
            sustainable solutions.
