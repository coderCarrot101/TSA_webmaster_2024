        <h3>Importance of Solar Energy</h3>
        <p>
            Solar panels have been around since 1883, and have come a long way since then. Solar energy 
            is found across America, used in office buildings, vehicles, and of course, homes. Being 
            almost completely carbon neutral, Solar energy produces less than 60 grams of carbon dioxide 
            per Kilowatt Hour, and after about three years, usually balances out. What truly makes solar 
            power remarkable however, is its ability to be conveniently and cheaply used within any home 
            through solar panels. A solar panel-powered home comes with many benefits besides reducing 
            your footprint. During power outages, solar panels can provide a reliable source of 
            electricity, ensuring essential appliances like refrigerators and medical devices remain 
            functional. Additionally, solar panels can significantly reduce electricity bills over time, 
            offering long-term savings and energy independence.

            <p>
                This method of generating electricity is often used for individual residential projects, 
                although solar farms are also common for large scale community power. Solar panels work by 
                capturing sunlight using photovoltaic cells, which convert sunlight into electricity through 
                the movement of electrons, this energy is then sent off to the various parts of a system. The 
                best way for prospecting homeowners to get involved with solar is through solar panel 
                installation companies such as Sunpower, Tesla, and Blue Raven.
