        <h3>Importance of Solar Energy</h3>
        <p>
            Solar panels have been around since 1883, and have come a long way since then. Solar energy 
            is found across America, used in office buildings, vehicles, and of course, homes. Being 
            almost completely carbon neutral, Solar energy produces less than 60 grams of carbon dioxide 
            per Kilowatt Hour, and after about three years, usually balances out. What truly makes solar 
            power remarkable however, is its ability to be conveniently and cheaply used within any home 
            through solar panels. A solar panel-powered home comes with many benefits besides reducing 
            your footprint. During power outages, solar panels can provide a reliable source of 
            electricity, ensuring essential appliances like refrigerators and medical devices remain 
            functional. Additionally, solar panels can significantly reduce electricity bills over time, 
            offering long-term savings and energy independence.

                This method of generating electricity is often used for individual residential projects, <br>
                although solar farms are also common for large scale community power. Solar panels work by <br>
                capturing sunlight using photovoltaic cells, which convert sunlight into electricity through <br>
                the movement of electrons, this energy is then sent off to the various parts of a system. The <br>
                best way for prospecting homeowners to get involved with solar is through solar panel <br>
                installation companies such as <a href="https://us.sunpower.com/">Sunpower</a>, <a href="https://www.tesla.com/solarpanels">Tesla</a>, and <a href="https://blueravensolar.com/">Blue Raven</a>.

                <!--financial incentives and ways to legally evade taxes. (I think thats what the google doc meant?)-->
                <p>
                    Initial costs for solar energy usage for homeowners within the United states is <br>
                    around $2.50 per Kilowatt, or about $11,500 for a six kilowatt system. Important things <br>
                    to note however is that the average cost of solar has gone down every year since 2009,<br>
                    and that these prices vary from state to state. However this initial cost is worthwhile <br>
                    as solar has an extremely high return on investment. At around 10%, and within a few <br>
                    years a six kilowatt solar power system saves the typical household about $1,500 per<br>
                    year. Electricity companies will also offer bonuses for excess electricity your solar <br>
                    panels generate. We recommend visiting the

                    There are many government incentive programs in place as of 2024. These can help lower the<br>
                    cost of initial installment as well as upkeep cost throughout their use. Congress has <br>
                    passed a Solar Investment Tax Credit for the past several years that now provides a 30% <br>
                    tax credit for systems installed as of 2024. There are also many local organizations that <br>
                    can provide homeowners with benefits. You should check out the Department of Energy's
